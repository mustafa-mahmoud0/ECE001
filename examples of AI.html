     <h3>  Siri and Alexa </h3> 
	 - The challenge with voice-activated assistants – which play an ever growing role in business – is that they need to actually understand human speech. Even harder: they need to actually understand humans.

 <h3>  Amazon and Online Commerce </h3> 
	
	-The concept of a system that responds to customer input isn’t by itself an example of artificial intelligence. For example, those ads for shirts that follow you around the Internet after you’ve casually checked out shirts aren’t necessarily an advanced AI application.
	
	<br /> - But in the case of Amazon’s recommendation system, it’s a powerhouse of a transactional AI platform. You have likely observed its ability to learn – and keep learning – season after season. In essence, hordes of shoppers are “teaching” the Amazon AI system to better display likely items for sale. That is, to match one item with another that the past has shown will prompt a sale. And to link semi-related concepts (like, say, light stands with photographic equipment). <br />
	
	<h3> AI Robotics, Humanoid and Otherwise  </h3> 
	
	- AI powers countless robots, including UC Berkely’s BRETT and the infamous MIT dog. An example of an AI-powered robot that’s gained media buzz is Sophia, who chatted and sang (albeit rather robotically) with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show.
	
	<h3> Online Banking  </h3> 
	
	- Your bank makes you a convenient offer: scan your check and deposit it with your mobile device. No need to visit the actual branch office. The problem: doing so requires a machine to read human hand writing, which is a messy and confusing endeavor – even for humans.
	
	<h3>  Social Networks </h3> 
	
	- The major social media networks are a core driver of the development of artificial intelligence. Facebook in particular seemingly uses every aspect of AI. For instance, its algorithm defines your timeline, deciding to show or not show certain of your friends’ posts on your timeline. Facebook knows that if everyone of your friends was displayed, your timeline would be so cluttered it would be off-putting. So the timeline algorithm learns who you interact with and who you normally ignore. (So if you want to see more of a friend’s posts, you might want to actually Like it).
