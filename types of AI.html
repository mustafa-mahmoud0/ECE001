	    <h2>	<u> types of : the Artificial Intelligence </u> </h2>
	    <h3>AI type-1: Based on Capabilities: </h3> 
	 <br />	1- Weak AI or Narrow AI : Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.<br />
	<br />	2- General AI :General AI is a type of intelligence which could perform any intellectual task with efficiency like a human.<br />
		<br /> 3-  Super AI : Super AI is a level of Intelligence of Systems at which machines could surpass human intelligence, and can perform any task better than human with cognitive properties. It is an outcome of general AI.<br />
		<h3>  Artificial Intelligence type-2: Based on functionality : </h3> 
		<br />1- Reactive Machines :Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.
Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.<br />
		<br />2- Limited Memory:Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.
These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.<br />
	 <br />	3-Theory of Mind :Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.
This type of AI machines are still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.<br />
		<br />4-Self-Awareness :Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent, and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.
These machines will be smarter than human mind.
Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.<br />
